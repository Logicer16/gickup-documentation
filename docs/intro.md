# Backup all your repositories with **Ease**.

Gickup is written in [go](https://go.dev/).

It is not necessary to have git installed on your system.
You can backup all your or favorite repositories from:
- [Github](https://github.com/)
- [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/)
- [Gogs](https://gogs.io/)
- [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
- [Onedev](https://code.onedev.io/)
- [Sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org/)

Or basically everywhere with enough configuration.
